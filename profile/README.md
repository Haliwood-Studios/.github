## Welcome to Haliwood Studios

This is a place where fun, small, interesting or completely useless projects can be found.
Most of the stuff is developed in my free time or during my live streams on Twitch.

What are we working on?
Well, I've got a lot of ideas, and the sky is the limit.
Some of the projects I'm working on are:

### Creating Optical Illusions

Using stable diffusion networks in combination with different so-called "control networks", we can
create images that contain other, hidden images.
We force certain conditions on the network during image creation.
One such example are "Squint Images" that reveal a hidden image when you squint your eyes.
